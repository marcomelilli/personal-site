My name is **Marco Melilli** and I'm a web and mobile **developer** with 5+ years of experience

<span style="font-size: 25px; margin-right: 15px;" class="fa fa-briefcase"></span>
I'm currently a **web developer** and Technology Consultant at **HPE** in Italy. I previously worked on **Avanade** as hybrid mobile app developer.

<span style="font-size: 25px; margin-right: 15px;" class="fa fa-rocket"></span>
I enjoy **learning** and studying all the new technologies, this is the reason why I'm always working on many little projects like **mobile apps** and **home automation**.
I'm the co-creator of [Big Bench App](https://big-bench.com) and you can find my open source projects on my project sections or on my _github_.

Obtained my **Bachelor of Computer Science** from the _University of Palermo_ , Italy. My thesis project involved developing a tracking system with low cost sensors (inertial measurement unit).

Grew up and studied in **Palermo**, Italy; I lived for a while in **A Coruna** (Spain) for the Erasmus projects during my university years and finally moved to **Milan** to work in 2015.
I love travel, play chess and meeting new people!
